# 👋 Hi, I'm Jean

I'm a Data Science and AI coach at **BeCode**, with hands-on experience as an **NLP engineer** and a deep curiosity for everything in the data domain — from classical statistics to cutting-edge LLMs.

## 💼 What I Do
As a coach, I guide job seekers through the intricacies of data science (ML and AI as well), analysis and engineering, while continuing to build and explore solutions myself. I’m also passionate about cloud-native development, CI/CD, and DevOps practices. I find it deeply satisfying to design robust, elegant workflows that make data solutions reproducible, scalable, and easy to deploy — turning prototypes into production-ready systems.

My background includes working on:
- 🔎 **Semantic search engines** leveraging dense vector representations and similarity measures
- **Keywords generation and deduplication** leveraging dense vector representations and similarity measures
- ☁️ **Cloud-native Python applications** for scalability
- ⚙️ APIs, and deployment workflows

## 🧰 Tech Stack
Python • Hugging Face • spaCy • scikit-learn  • NLP
Docker • FastAPI • SQL • Git • AWS  • Linux    

## 🎓 Coaching Philosophy
I believe learning by doing is the most effective path. My goal as a coach is to bridge the gap between theory and practice, encouraging students to build real-world solutions, write clean code, and understand the "why" behind the tools.

## 🧠 Always Learning
I'm currently diving deeper into:
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- MLOps best practices
- Agents
